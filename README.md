<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<br />
<ul>
  <li><b>Incident Severity</b>: High</li>
  <li><b>Incident Status</b>: Resolved</li>
  <li><b>Incident Overview</b>: On September 3, 2024 at 08:30:00, a suspicious amount of logs were found within the system events on the firewall. The logs indicated that the firewall was under a brute force attack from various IPs. After analyzing the logs it seems the brute force attack was aimed at compromising the administrator login on the firewall. Changes were quickly made to the firewallâ€™s login timeout after 3 failed  attempts. This dramatically reduced the number of logs generated and resources used. In addition to the timeout, HTTPS administrative access was disabled on WAN and a VPN tunnel was created for offsite      administrative access. Once HTTPS access was disabled the attack was stopped. </li>
  <li><b>Key Findings</b>: Due to an improper WAN configuration on the firewall for remote access. Attackers were able to find the admin web interface using the public IP. This allowed attackers to run scripts that would attempt different passwords and usernames from various IPs but were not able to gain access to any administrator accounts.</li>
  <li><b>Immediate Actions</b>: A timeout after 3 failed login attempts was set in place to slow down the attack. This allowed enough time to configure A VPN tunnel and disabled the HTTPS administrator web interface after testing and ensuring that the VPN tunnel allowed administrator web interface access. </li>
  <li><b>Stakeholder Impact</b>: The impact on systems was minimal with no notice in network performance degradation. Many un-analyzed logs on the firewall memory were purged because of the extreme number of logs that were generated. </li>
</ul>
